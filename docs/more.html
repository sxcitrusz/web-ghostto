        <p class="more_description">Sharing a Mekong River border with Laos, Loei province is in many ways more similar to the north of Thailand than to the rest of Isan, even earning the nickname “the Mae Hong Son of the northeast.” Loei is an up-and-coming ecotourism region surrounded by undulating mountain ranges, abundant with various kinds of flora and capped with fog enshrouded summits. The most majestic mountains are Phu Kradueng, Phu Luang and Phu Ruea. However, while Loei features numerous outdoor activities and fascinating cultural attractions, tourism is relatively new to the province and the area is greatly unspoiled.</p>
        
        <p class="more_description">At Phu Kradung, travellers can see the beautiful sunrise and scenic views of fields and mountains at the Pha Nok Ann viewpoint. Along the trails, you can find heather Flowers, and their fully blooming season is during March – April. If you want to see the Sunset, Pha Lomsak is the most popular viewpoint. Moreover, you can walk on the trail to see Anodard pond, Phen waterfall and Pha Yearb Mek. You may spend 3 days to explore every attraction in Phu Kardung.</p>
        
        <p class="more_description">Phu Ruea national park is another Alternative. The National Park is located in the big mountain with the large pine tree field. It is less difficult than in Phu Kradung because you can drive to the campsite. Phu Ruea (sailboat mountain) National Park is named after the outstanding sail-shaped cliff in the national park.</p>
          
        <p class="more_description">Chiang Khan is a peaceful city with interesting attractions. Kaeng Kud Koo, for example, is the clusters of rocks with beautiful colours under the river. In dry season when the river level declines, you will see the colours and beauty of the rocks. Chiang Khan Walking street is one of the places you can’t miss. You can enjoy walking and Shopping local products and Food on the street with the over-100-year buildings along both sides of the street. The recommended food are Khaoa Pieak Sen (rice noodles soup), Mieng Kham (savoury leaf wraps), Khaow Chee (grilled sticky rice), and ancient ice-cream.</p>

        <p class="more_description">Phi Ta Khon museum is situated in Wat Phon Chai, Amphoe Dan Sai, Loei. It exhibits the history of inherited culture and traditions including "Phi Ta Khon", the traditional amusement that has been inherited for a long time. Boon Phi Ta Khon Festival is a part of Boon Luang Festival, a big merit festival of the year in this area that combines Boon Prevet Festival (Heet Duen See) and Boon Bung Fai Festival (Heet Duen Hok) together. The purpose of Boon Pravet Festival is to tell the Sermon of the last great incarnation story of the Buddha. The purpose of Boon Bung Fai Festival is to cerebrate for the city angels and to make the rain falls in the right season. Phi Ta Khon in the parade will entertain people. It is said that Phi Ta Khon might came from wearing a mask that looks like Khon's head. Some call it "Phi Ta Kon", "Phi Tam Kon", and eventually "Phi Ta Khon".Apart from the exhibition of culture and traditions, the museum also exhibits various kinds of Phi Ta Khon. There are 2 types of Phi Ta Khon. The first type is Phi Ta Khon Yai, both female and male. This type of Phi Ta Khon is not made every year except in the determined ceremonies. The second type is Phi Ta Khon Lek that we see every year. There is also the demonstration of Phi Ta Khon mask making which has these following parts. The head is made from a half-folded earthenware steamer which looks like a hat. The face is made from a base of a coconut branch. It is sewed with the head part and then pierced for the eyes. The nose is made from a carved soft wood which looks like a human's nose. Now the trunk-shaped nose is more popular. The decoration is done by natural colors in the past such as calcium hydroxide, red lime, ashes, curcuma, and soot. However, oil color has been used instead since it gives more colorful color. Then small pieces of cloth are sewed together with the streamer and the face and will cover the shoulders. The process of Phi Ta Khon masks is finished. The museum also provides souvenir shop for visitors. Travelling From Dan Sai District Office, use the Public Highway No. 2114, passing Dan Sai Police Station and Dan Sai Market. After passing the bridge, Wat Phon Chai is on the left hand side. Phi Ta Khon is in this temple.
